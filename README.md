# Azure-Blueprints

# What are Azure Blueprints?
- Blueprints give admins the ability to orchestrate the deployment of artifacts to Azure


# How to use Blueprints?
- Blueprints will bbe used to automate using IaaS to deploy resources 
- First admins must define a blueprint and then assign it to a management group or a subscription
- Only can be assigned to management group or a subscription. NOT A resource group


# Stages of Azure Blueprint
- Define Blueprint -> Publish Blueprint -> Assign the Blueprint

# Blueprints Artifacts
- 1. Role Assignments - if you need specific roles to be assigned
- 2. Policy assignments - if you need specific policies to be applied
- 3. Resource groups - if you need certain resource groups to be in place
- 4. ARM templates - if there are resources that need to be deployed

# Working with Azure Blueprints
- Define the Blueprint, create some artifacts, publish the blueprint, and then assign the blueprint at a management group level to one subscription.
